# UDP_TO_TCP_Project
In this project I have tried to emulate the bahevaiour of a TCP connection on top of UDP Sockets. TCP ensures reliable packet delivery using various mechanisms such as acknowledgements, sequence numbers, time out for packets etc. I have implemented these on top of UDP sockets in Java.

Tech Stack used: Java
